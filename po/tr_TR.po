# This dialog is shown to the user when the memory card is found corrupted. The dialog should briefly tell the user that:
# 1. The memory (either memory card or device’s memory, specified in the title of the dialog) can not be used to write data to it, it's read-only. This will continue to be the case until the memory is somehow fixed.
# 2. The user can try to fix the card with PC (there's the repair function in the PC end, the name and place can change between OS, so that's why it's not mentioned more clearly). There will be more information in user guidance.
# 3. Only way to ensure that the data stored to the memory is safe is to back it up some where right away. If left to memory, it might get corrupted beyond repairing.
